# Code-Review Checklist

Code reviewing is important in Software Develpment Cycle.
Code review is a software quality assurance process in which a developer's code is looked over manually by a team of developers or by using an automated code review tool. The aim is to find bugs, fix errors and refactor the code.

## CheckList:

- Code Indentation and Formatting - Formatting helps make the code look more neat therefore making it easier to understand.

- Naming Conventions - Make sure the variable, method and functions names are understandable for other developers

- White-Spaces - Either clear too much white spaces or tidy the code to have some white spaces in order to make it easier to read

- Proper use of comments - Comments make looking at variables and methods and understanding what they are doing easier.

- Exception Handling - Helps to not break the application

- Code Complexity - Complex functionality make the application look better.

- Functional Requirements - Making sure that all requirements for the project is completed.

- Unit tests - Testing to see if the functionality of the application is working.

As a Reviewer:
- Be honest. If the code is not optimal, let the developer know so they can fix it and make it better.
- Be clear on your feedback. A reviewer should make themselves easy to understand to work with better.
- Stay away from small errors. Making a big deal out of nit-picking could cause less focus on more imporant issues.

As an Author:
- Respond to the feedback from reviewers. This way, both parties can learn and be able to work better together.
- Explain your commits. This will make it easier for reviewers to see what you did and how they can help.
- Be confident in what you have developed.
