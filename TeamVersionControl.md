# Team Version Control

In order to manage version control in this project I used Git and GitHub. I also used GitFlow processes in order to manager version control over in a team environment.

## GitFlow

Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow that helps with continuous software development and implementing DevOps practices. One can create feature branches from a develop branch and merge once the feature is done and tested. The development branch is then merged into the main to complete the project. 

## Branches of the Project:
- main: Formerly known as master. Completed project is located here.
- development: Develop or development. Contains all features before final release. Branching off this branch is common for developers. 

## Other Branches (Feature Branches):
- SQADevelopment: Contains the first commit of the project and the introduction of the documentation.
- Scrum sprint backlog and Task Estimation: Documentation on Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation.
- Unit testing and Test-Driven Cevelopment: Documentation on Unit testing and Test-Driven development.
- Test Coverage Cetric: Documentation on Test coverage metric.
- Team version-Control: Documentation on Team version-control.
- Code-review checklist: Documentation on Code-review checklist.

Once a feature is completed the branch is merged back into the develop branch.
It is impotant to have understandable git commit messages for other developers to understand what is going on and what needs to be added.
